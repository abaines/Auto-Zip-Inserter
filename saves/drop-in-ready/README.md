# Drop-in-Ready

## Purpose

This folder allows taking any standard Factorio map and adding a few simple/standard/QOL softmods to it.

## Instructions

Start by making your map using the in-game map generator.
Use whatever settings you want for your map.
Save the map to disk then locate it inside %appdata%/Factorio/Saves folder.
Unzip the map to that folder with a new name.
Verify that the unzipped map is in the correct location and still valid by opening it inside Factorio.

Next copy the files from this folder
(companionship.lua, hijack.lua, playerBonuses.lua & README.md)
into the unzipped map folder.
