# FishBus Gaming Softmods Collection 1

## About this collection

This is a collection of Factorio scenario code for the FishBus Gaming servers.  The starting goal is to take ideal functionality from several other softmods, and make it possible to have it run properly in a single server.  Later goals are sketchy as of yet.

This pack implements these features:
- A new layer of permissions management on top of the built-in permissions management;
- Autodeconstruct (marks miners with no resources for deconstruction) by 'mindmix';
- Fill4Me (for filling entities with fuel/ammo when placed);
- KTags (an evolved player "Tag" based on Band);
- THE Fish Market & Bank;
- AntiGrief, based on FMMO's AntiGrief tool;
- Death Markers;
- Blocked Player Colors;
- Game Time widget;
- A score widget with more information than what is built in;
- Vehicle Snap; and
- Info & Admin GUI tools, inspired by ExplosiveGaming.
