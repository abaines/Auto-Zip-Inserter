# NOTE:
# If you want to change the rules, you should add entries (or remove) in the
# "ruletype=Rule Verbiage" fashion, and then adjust the rules in the
# tab instantiation part of info_gui.lua.
# Look for the section starting with "dialog:addTab('rules',"

# Similar approaches should be used for modifying the other sections.

[info.modinfo]
title=ModInfo
tooltip=Information about the mods loaded on this server
softmod_title=Softmods Installed:
    sm_market=Fish Market - Fish are considered currency on this server. You can earn fish by fishing (duh), mining ores/rocks, chopping trees and killing biters. Trading with other players and Fish Farms are authorized. The Fish Market buildings are marked on the map. Feel free to request an admin place/remove Markets where convenient for you.
   sm_fishbiz=Fishy Bank UI - Something to do with all those fish so that you are not just giving them away to everyone else:   Put them in the bank!  The Bank UI lets you take your fish from your inventory and store them securely.  You can also withdraw them at any time to use them in purchases.  The bank also pays interest on your fish.  We do not know where the bank gets the fish from to pay interest, but that mystery is probably best left alone.
 sm_autodecon=Auto-deconstruct - Will automatically mark empty mines for deconstruction, except for uranium mines (saves acid connections)
   sm_fill4me=Fill4Me - A starter amount of the highest tier of any fuel/ammo you have in your main inventory will automatically be placed into entities you place.  (Can be turned off.)
 sm_deathmark=Death Marker - A map icon will be placed where you die. Automatically removed with corpse removal. Also sends out a global message notifying everyone on your death and your death count in square brackets.
   sm_vehsnap=Vehicle Snap - When driving your vehicle will auto align to the nearest 15 degree heading, easing driving pains.  (Can be turned off).
sm_flashlight=Flashlight technology - Flashlight is disabled in game until Batteries are researched.
     sm_score=Score GUI - Aliens killed counter/rockets launched/items launched.
